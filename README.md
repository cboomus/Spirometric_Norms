This Python program predicts maximum lung volumes and maximum inhalation flow rates
based on features of weight, height, height, sex, age, ethnicity, and race
with use of ML algorithms of linear regression, SVM, random forest, and XG Boost.

The dataset is derived from the article Beyond the Expiratory Limb: A Complete Raw 
Spirometry Dataset by DL Ibraheem et al and published in Front Physiol 2022; 13: 898831. 
It consists of a table of demographics and a table of spirometric data.
